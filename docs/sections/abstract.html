    This specification describes a Linked Data vocabulary for asserting
    Verifiable Credentials related to supply chain and other traceability 
    information, similar to what is often referred to as "provenance",
    including country of origin, chemical properties, mechanical properties,
    and other attributes of products and materials.  VCs using these terms 
    can then be used to help determine the legitimacy of organizations
    participating in global trade and the status of the products and 
    materials described therein.
